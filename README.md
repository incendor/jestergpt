## About
You're the court jester to a very picky monarch (powered by "AI") and today decides about your fate. Please the king and save your neck or end up in the dungeons!

Utilize your repository of commonly accepted medieval joke templates and spice them up with funny plot twists in this Cards-Against-Humanity-style blank text game where you try to convince a somewhat limited pseudo-AI that you're actually funny.
